# Introduction

This project is an AI-powered attendance tracking system that leverages facial recognition technology for seamless and efficient attendance management. Built with the DeepFace library, it integrates MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) for face detection and FaceNet for face recognition and embedding generation.

Key Features
Face Detection with MTCNN: Identifies faces in images or video streams, ensuring accurate and robust performance across diverse scenarios.
Facial Recognition with FaceNet: Extracts facial embeddings, enabling precise identification and differentiation of individuals.
Seamless Attendance Logging: Automates the
attendance tracking process, saving time and reducing manual errors.

# Use Cases

This system is ideal for:

- Educational Institutions: Automate student attendance tracking during lectures or exams.
- Corporate Environments: Manage employee check-ins and check-outs with minimal manual intervention.
- Events and Conferences: Ensure accurate attendee logging for better organization and reporting.

With this project, you can build a reliable and scalable facial recognition-based attendance solution that integrates cutting-edge AI models into a practical, real-world application.
